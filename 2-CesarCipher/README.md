The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest known and simplest ciphers. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain 
number of places down the alphabet. 

For example, with a shift of 1, `a` would be replaced by `b`, `b` would become `c`, and so on. 

The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.
