If you want to learn more about [Property Based Testing](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/know-for-sure-with-property-based-testing)
using the [qwik library](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html)

* check out this repository (`master` branch)
* set it up (see `Setup in IntelliJ`)
* follow the `Property-Based-Testing Intro` below

## Setup in IntelliJ

1. If you use IntelliJ, create a new empty Java project and 

    * add [fizzBuzz](./1-FizzBuzz) 
    * add [cesarCipher](./2-CesarCipher)
      as modules to your project.

2. Run the existing tests in both modules to get all libraries in place and tho see, that the initial setup works.<br>
   **Expected outcome**: All should build and tests should be green.

## Property-Based-Testing Intro

1. Checkout the `01-fizzbuzz-JUNIT5`-branch with a sample solution [kata.FizzBuzz](./1-FizzBuzz/src/main/java/kata/FizzBuzz.java) 
   and take a look in the corresponding [junit5-test](./1-FizzBuzz/src/test/java/kata/FizzBuzzTest.java)).<br>
   **Question**: All fine?

2. TODO ... go on ..
